# ANN from Scratch

Artificial Neural Networks form the basic building blocks of Deep Learning algorithms.


They are computational models inspired by the human brain.
Comprising interconnected nodes or neurons organized into layers, ANNs learn from data through training, adjusting connection weights to minimize errors. Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing networks to capture complex patterns.


## Steps Involved

> Inputs

1.   $X_1$ - Body temperature
2.   $X_2$ - Presence of cough
3.   $X_3$ - Presence of covid in primary contacts
4.   $X_4$ - Tastelesness


> Output

*   Y - Patient is covid positive (1) or covid negative (0)
